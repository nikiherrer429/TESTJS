    1. Problem 1 - (A)
    Create an Object with a "hello" method that writes "Hello <name> in the console"
*/

// Creates a constant variable 'greeter' and initializes it with an object 
const greeter = {

  //Asign the method called as 'hello' with the 'greeter' object and usign the method as an anonymous function using 'function' as keyword
 hello: function() {
    //Ask for the name with the prompt fuction creating a dialog box with a message and an input field, the value is stored in the name  variable usign the 'conts' keyword
    const name = prompt("Please enter your name:");
    //here we use 'console.log'to output the message to the console; it concatenates the string "hello" and the value stored in name variable
    console.log("Hello " + name);

// Call the hello method of the greeter object. when exceuted it will prompt the string name plus the value stord in name variable.

/*
    2. Problem 1 - (B)
    How would you make name inmutable?
    (Can write or just describe)

*/
//You can use the 'const' keyword to declare it, this will prevent the reassigment of the 'name' variable once itÂ´s has been initialized, taking the code avobe we can see that the value is inmutable

    3. Problem 2
    Write a funtion that logs the 5 cities that occur the most in the array below in
    order from the most number of occurrences to least.

  const cityCounts = {};
  
  // here we count the occurrences of each city taking care of the repeat ones

    if (cityCounts[city]) {
      cityCounts[city]++;
    } else {
      cityCounts[city] = 1;
    }
  });
  
  // now we convert the object into an array of [city, count] pairs
  const cityCountsArray = Object.entries(cityCounts);
  
  // the next step is sorting the array based on the count in descending order
  cityCountsArray.sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
  
  // and finally we can log the 5 cities with the most occurrences
  for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(5, cityCountsArray.length); i++) {
